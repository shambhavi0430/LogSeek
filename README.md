LogSeek is an educational and interactive application designed to demonstrate the efficiency of the binary search algorithm through an intuitive interface built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. The project highlights how binary search operates in O(log n) time complexity, efficiently finding a target element in a sorted dataset. Users can input their own arrays and target values to perform a search, with the results displayed clearly and quickly, showing how binary search narrows down the search range.

Key Features:
Interactive Binary Search: LogSeek allows users to input their own sorted lists and select a target element to search for, providing a hands-on experience with the binary search algorithm.
Efficient Search: The application performs the search in O(log n) time, demonstrating the efficiency of binary search compared to other search methods like linear search.
Detailed Output: The result of the search is presented clearly, indicating whether the target element was found and at which index, or if the element is absent from the list.
User-friendly Interface with Tkinter: A simple and clean GUI built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to input data and initiate the search process.
Performance Insights: LogSeek highlights the number of steps taken in the search process, giving users a better understanding of how the binary search algorithm reduces the problem size with each step.
Technology Stack:
Python: Core language for implementing the binary search algorithm.
Tkinter: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI), enabling easy interaction with the search functionality.
Algorithmic Complexity: LogSeek emphasizes logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making it a great educational tool for understanding efficient searching.
Use Case:
LogSeek is ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning and practicing the binary search algorithm. It offers an interactive and practical approach to understanding the concepts behind logarithmic time complexity, making it a valuable tool for computer science education.
